  <h4>Daily life</h4>
  <p>So today i was very excited as i was going to my sisters weeding to rawande in ahmednagar and i met many of my brothers and friends their and enjoyed a lot with my old friends and brothers then we went to shirdi on 24 and i dont know why but my sister is very mad and her words always hurt our family as she says anything to parents and us maybe she is not exposed to the world more and hence she dont hav emore social personlaity. She is so  mad as she says anything in public without worrying about others and we thought after her marriage she will be better but no. Our plan was to finish wedding at 2 then go to shirdi and then upto 6 finish darsahan and then go to chincholi, drop grandmother to mamas house and then to our home till 10 but during the darshan father got veruy tired and legs was paining so we decided to stay at mamas house then we go to mamas house at 8 after having dinner then we talk a lot and then sleep next day on 25 me an ma=om go to various houses to give sarees and also to talk so we go but my father wanted to go to home early so we leave at 11 after having lunch and then reached home at 4 i was very tired as i was ocntiniously driving the car upro 400 km so i was very tired and sleep after coming to home</p>
