  <h1>Blog for 19th May 2025</h1>
  <h4>Coding Journey</h4>
  <p>Today was a great day as in the journey of my machine learning a-z course i completed many topics like decision trees, polynomial regression, random forest regression. today i also try to solve the titanic problem on kaagle but it went too hard and at the end with taking small helps of chatgpt when needed i solve it. But i came to understand that my basics in numpy and pandas are not clear and i want to improve that . i also learn some important things like when we do a columntranfer on a pandas dataframe it is converted into a numpy array and the input of train or test in the model must be a 2d numpy array and also for the inverse transfor or transform the input must be a numpy 2d array</p>
  <p>Also i understand various important things like reshaping a numpy array using .reshape(-1,1) which proved to be very helpful</p>
  <h5>Topics Covered</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Polynomial regression</li>
        <li>Standard vector regression</li>
        <li>Decision Trees</li>
        <li>Random Forest Regression</li>
        </ul>
  <h4>Daily life</h4>
  <p>I today opened linkedin and i see a post of my cs batchie and i got stunned. he had prepared a model to predict the house prices and i check it out. he uses various advance features like pipelines and feature engineering and when i searched i got to know that these topics are not even in my cours and i got sad at first then think that he is a cs grad and i am a geology so he is definetly smarter than me and will get a higher package than me, besides that today weather was very nice along with rain.</p>
